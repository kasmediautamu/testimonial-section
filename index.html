                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I 
                    learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                     joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                     bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
                      have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                       here. I signed up for the free intro course and 
                       found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly 
                       thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                        most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                         the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, 
                         working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

              <p class="testimonial-card__description">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
